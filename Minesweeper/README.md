# Minesweeper

The classic game we all grew up in our WindowsXp computers. <br />

Though it's written in C and it's played in a terminal with no GUI. <br />




In order to play you need only to compile and execute the binary file. <br />

It has three levels of difficulty : <br />
&emsp   Easy <br />
&emsp   Medium <br />
&emsp   Expert <br />

Each level depending the difficulty has a bigger canvas and more mines distributed.
